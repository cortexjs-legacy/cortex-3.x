[简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

**Cortex** is a package manager for the web with a bunch of end-to-end integrated frontend solutions to make your websites better, including:

- frontend package management with version control;
- compatible backend solutions for JAVA and node.js;
- development environment for your entire workflow;
- [CI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) solutions to support multiple testing environment simultaneously;
- global registry service;
- CDN solutions.

With [Cortex](https://github.com/cortexjs/cortex), we write web modules **exactly** the same as we do with [node.js](http://nodejs.org), with no [Module/Wrappings](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/Wrappings), no [AMD](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/AsynchronousDefinition), etc.

Cortex is designed and maintained for large websites and collaborative development and is also convenient for small projects.

## Installation

First, you need to install [node](http://nodejs.org) (>= 0.8.0), then run the following command in your command line:

```sh
npm install -g cortex
```
